PUBLIC FID

# Mission and Values
Be a company specializing on facial recognition services. Empowering our customers processes and providing products and services based on facial recognition. Most importantly, be an integrated, respectful and focused team for our customers.

# Solution description
Our service platform provides people information based on a facial identifier for each person. 
Basically we have the idea of keeping significant data from people around the world and keeping it updated in a BIG DATA database. Each person will have a Facial ID, such as a digital fingerprint.
Companies will contract our services for any type of event that involves facial recognition. We will provide our BIG DATA with our products and devices for facial recognition.
On the other hand, each event will provide us with new information or up-to-date information from people. This is the big reason for calling the solution "PUBLIC FID".

Our services can be used for: Security, meetings, access permissions, missing people and many others that we can imagine.

Our solution will use several technologies such as: BIG DATA, cognitive services for facial recognition and augmented and virtual reality. It can be used on mobiles, tablets, glasses and many other devices with virtual and augmented reality support.
By accessing the product's website, you can download the Android App on your phone or tablet.
